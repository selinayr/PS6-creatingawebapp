- In the first panel, I used satellite temperature data from UAH, and temperature *temp* is measured as deviation (deg C) from 1991-2020 baseline. The dataset contains 14310 observations and 4 variables.You can choose a random sample of data for 10, 25, 50, or 100 entries. 

- In the second panel, I made a plot analyzing the global temperature for different regions. You can select the regions you are interested in, and you will see a monthly scatterplot and the corresponding trend lines. The plot will generate a distribution for the region(s) selected. The plot shows the year-month as the x-axis, a random color to each filtered region, a trend line if the user wants them, and the number of observations in the subset and range of the dates. 

In the third panel, I created a table which displays average temperature over different time periods, *month*, *year*, and *decades*. It filter the data based on the user's selection. The wedgit includes a radio button group to select the time period to display, and the output will include a text to show the temperature range and a table of the data.
